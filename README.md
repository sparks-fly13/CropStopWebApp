## Problem Theme: AgroTech

## Problem Statement:
Agriculture is the backbone of the world's economy,
providing food and raw materials for various industries. However,
farmers face numerous challenges in crop cultivation, ranging from price
uncertainty to crop diseases and a lack of information on which crops to
grow. These challenges not only affect farmers' livelihoods but also
impact food security and the global economy.

How can farmers improve their crop yields while reducing their costs and
risks associated with farming, and how can they stay up-to-date with the
latest news and innovations in the agricultural industry?

Farmers across the world face significant challenges in crop
cultivation, including weather patterns, soil quality, access to
resources, and price uncertainty. These challenges have far-reaching
economic and social implications, as agriculture is a major source of
employment and income. Detecting and diagnosing crop diseases is often
difficult, and farmers lack access to information on which crops to grow
and how to optimize their cultivation. Innovative solutions that
leverage technology and data can help to address these challenges, and
platforms like CropStop can empower farmers with real-time market data,
disease detection tools, and crop recommendations based on machine
learning models to build a more resilient and sustainable agriculture
sector.

### 2\. Services:

#### \* Potato Disease Detector: 
The potato disease detector is
a machine learning model that uses a deep learning algorithm to detect
diseases in potato plants by analyzing images of their leaves. It
identifies symptoms such as discoloration or unusual growth patterns,
and continually updates and refines its accuracy with more images. This
tool helps farmers and researchers take action to prevent further damage
or the spread of disease.

#### \* Crop Price Predictor: 
Crop price predictor is a machine learning
model that helps farmers and traders make informed decisions about
buying and selling crops based on accurate insights about specific
regions and markets.

#### \* Crop Recommender: Get ready to meet your new agricultural advisor -
the crop recommender! Using n, p, k values, temperature, humidity, pH,
and rainfall data, this machine learning model suggests which crops are
most likely to grow and thrive in your area. With its help, you can
optimize yields, increase profits, and promote sustainable agriculture
practices. So, say goodbye to guesswork and hello to bountiful harvests
with the crop recommender!

## Scalability:
\* Crop Yield Predictor: The crop yield model will leverage
advanced algorithms to help farmers accurately predict their crop yields
and enable them to make informed decisions regarding their farming
practices. It will be powered by an advanced model that takes into
account a wide range of weather and soil data. By analyzing these data
points, the model can provide highly accurate predictions for a variety
of crops.

\* User Authentication: To ensure that our users\' data is kept safe and
secure, we'll employ industry-standard user authentication protocols to
authenticate and authorize access to our platform. A secure connection
between our webpage and machine learning models to prevent data breaches
and unauthorized access will be maintained. This will ensure that our
users can use the platform with confidence, knowing that their past
activities and data are stored safely and securely.
